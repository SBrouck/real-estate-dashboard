## Project Overview

During my internship as a Real Estate Investment Analyst at **Mantu**, I was responsible for automating the data extraction and analysis of a ‚Ç¨200M real estate portfolio. The goal was to centralize operational and financial indicators in a single, dynamic dashboard to support efficient portfolio management.

While the original project was developed in Power BI, this public version recreates part of the logic and analytics in **Python and Streamlit**, to demonstrate my ability to:

- Automate financial and operational reporting
- Perform data analysis across multiple dimensions (KPI, filters, visualizations)
- Package and deploy a complete data product independently

This project is designed to be relevant for roles such as **Business Analyst**, **Data Analyst**, **Data Scientist**, or **Data Engineer**, and showcases my technical versatility in building end-to-end data solutions.
